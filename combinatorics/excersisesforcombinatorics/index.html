            <p>Here is one of my favourite questions involving the choose function</p>
        </div>
        <p>Find the number of rectangles in this figure. Try it before looking at the solution!
        </p>
        <img src="grid.jpg">
        <button class="accordion">Show the solution</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                For this question, we note that any 2 points on each side of the whole figure, when lines are drawn through the selected points, rectangles would be formed. There are 5 points on the length of the figure and 4 points on the breadth of the figure. Therefore, we choose 2 points among the 5 points for the length and 2 points among the 4 points for the breadth. The answer would be 5C2x4C2=60.
                <br>Note: this question could also be solved by counting manually. However this takes a long time so it is recommended to use the method above.

                this.classList.toggle("active");
