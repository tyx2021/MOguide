        <h3>Factorials</h3>
        <p> Let me introduce to you a new function! No, literally. You don't get it? The new function is '!'. </p>
        <p>So what does this ! mean? Let's see if you can figure it out yourself<br>1!=1<br>2!=2<br>3!=6<br>4!=24<br>5!=120</p>
        <p>If you couldn't see it, it's fine. However, if you did see it you really are a genius!</p>
        <code>n!=n(n-1)(n-2)....1</code>
        <p>So, for example 5!=5x4x3x2x1=120</p>
        <p>Now, you might recognise these numbers</p>
        <p>That's because, you've seen them in the introduction!</p>
        <p>You see, if you have n gifts and n friends, the number of possibilities is n!</p>
        <p>Now, here is a factorial calculator. Play with it to your heart's desire!</p>
        <form>
            <p>What number do you want to take the factorial of?</p>
            <input type="text" id="factorialinput">
        </form>
        <button onclick="factorial()">Submit</button>
        <p id="factorialoutput"></p>
        <h3>The Subfactorial</h3>
        <p>The Subfactorial is a function which is the factorial, but with added conditions. First, let's define the Subfactorial</p>
        <code>!n = Subfactorial of n</code>
        <p>Okay, so what is the Subfactorial? Imagine the case where we have n friends and n gifts. But now each of the friends already has a predetermined gift</p>
        <p>The Subfactorial tells you how many possible cases there are where none of the gifts are given to the correct person</p>
        <p>However, the function for finding the Subfactorial is quite complicated. So, we normally just memorise the values since no competition will ask for large Subfactorials</p>
        <p>!1=0<br>!2=1<br>!3=2<br>!4=9<br>!5=44</p>
        <p>Of course, if you really have to find the subfactorials of larger values, remember this pattern:<br>
        !(n + 1)=(n - 1)(!n + !(n-1))
        </p>
        <h3>The Choose Function</h3>
        <p>So we have covered permutation, which is finding the number of possibilities of something. Now we will be exploring combinations, or known as binomial coefficients or “choosing”. </p>
        <p>Combinations literally means choosing, for example there are 10 points on a circle, and we want to find out how many straight lines can be drawn within the circle with no lines overlapping. This can be written as 10C2, or “choose 2 from 10”. </p>
        <p>The formula for nCr is:</p>
        <code>n!/r!(n-r)!</code>
        <p>Fun fact: nCr is the same as nC(n-r). Remember this formula well as it would help you in a lot of future questions.
