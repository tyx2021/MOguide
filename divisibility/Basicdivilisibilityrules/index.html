        <h1>Basic Divisibility Rules</h1>
        <p>Here are the most basic divisibility rules. Do note that if you have a divisibility rule for a number like 12, the number must work for both the divisibility rule of 3 and 4</p>
        <p>Divisibility by 2</p>
        <p>The number must end in 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 or 8</p>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                For any number <span class="overline">abc......x</span> = <span class="overline">abc......0 </span> + x. Hence <span class="overline">abc......0</span> must be divisible by 2 and thus to determine whether or not a number is divisible by 2 depends completely on the last digit x. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Divisibility by 3</p>
        <p>The sum of digits must be divisible by 3</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the proof</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Notice how 10 = 9 + 1. Therefore 10^n would also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So for any number, the sum of digits determines if the number is divisible by 3. This can be shown very easily for as many digits as you want. But for simplicity's sake, we will do it with 3 since <span class="overline">abc</span> = 100a + 10b + c = 99a + 9b + c =9(11a + b) + a + b + c
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Divisibility by 4</p>
        <p>The last two digits must be divisible by 4</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the proof</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Similarly to the proof for divisibility by 2, we realise that any number <span class="overline">abc......xy</span> = <span>abc......00</span> + <span class="overline">xy</span>. Since <span>abc......00</span> is divisible by 4, seeing if a number <span class="overline">abc......xy</span> is divisible by 4 depends completely on <span class="overline">xy</span></p>
        </div>
        <p>Divisibility by 5</p>
        <p>The last digit must be 0 or 5</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the proof</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Similarly to the proof for divisibility by 2, notice that for any number <span class="overline">abc......x</span> = <span class="overline">abc......0 </span> + x. Hence <span class="overline">abc......0</span> must be divisible by 5 and thus to determine whether or not a number is divisible by 5 depends completely on the last digit x. Since 5 and 0 are the only digits divisible by 5, if those numbers are x, it would be divisible by 5.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Divisibility by 7</p>
        <p>This one is more complicated. Take the last digit and subtract two times of it from the rest of the number</p>
        <p>There is also another method, but this is the same as divisibility by 13 so go check those out instead.</p>

                This is left as an excersise to the reader<br>
                Just kidding, but the concepts for these are a bit too complicated for you to understand right now so they will be covered in the modular arithmetic page
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Divisibility by 8</p>
        <p>The last 3 digits must be divisible by 8</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the proof</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Similarly to the proof for divisibility by 2, we realise that any number <span class="overline">abc......xyz</span> = <span>abc......000</span> + <span class="overline">xyz</span>. Since <span>abc......000</span> is divisible by 4, seeing if a number <span class="overline">abc......xyz</span> is divisible by 4 depends completely on <span class="overline">xyz</span>
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Divisibility by 9</p>
        <p>The sum of digits must be divisible by 9</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the proof</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Notice how 10 = 9 + 1. Therefore 10^n would also have a remainder of 1 when divided by 9. So for any number, the sum of digits determines if the number is divisible by 9.

            </p>
        </div>
        <p>Divisibility by 11</p>
        <p>The difference between the sum of odd and even digits is divisible by 11</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the proof</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
               Notice how 10 = 11 - 1. This results in the proof. Don't worry, more details will be covered in the Modular Arithmetic Portion.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>Divisibility by 13</p>
        <p>They are in the form of <span class="overline">abcabcabc...abc </span> where there are an even number of "abc"s</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the proof</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
                Notice that 1001 = 7 x 11 x 13. Since abcabc = 1001 x abc and any <span class="overline">abcabc......</span> where there are an even number of "abc"s is a multiple of abcabc. Hence, any <span class="overline">abcabc......</span> with an even number of "abc"s is divisible by 13.
