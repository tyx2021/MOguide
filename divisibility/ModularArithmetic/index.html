        <h1>Modular Arithmetic</h1>
        <h2>Introduction: What is Modular Arithmetic?</h2>
        <p>In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801.</p>
        <p class="credit">This is from wikipedia</p>
        <p>So, how does Modular Arithmetic work?</p>
        <p>Essentially, Modular Arithmetic is "remainder" but better. If you don't know what a remainder is, a remainder is the amount of stuff left after you divide something. For example 7 &#247; 4 = 1 remainder 3 because 1 x 4 + 3 = 7</p>
        <p>Simple enough, now if we use the previous example, we could rewrite it as 7=3(mod 4) because 3 was the remainder when 7 was divided by 4. In general, if x &#247; y = a Remainder(From here on referred as R) z where a is a whole no., y = z(mod x)</p>
        <p>Now try this question:What is 10(mod 3)?</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the solution</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>10 &#247; 3 = 3 R 1 </p>
            <p>Therefore 10 = 1(mod 3)</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Properties of Modular Arithmetic </h2>
        <p>One very important property is this:</p>
        <p>If x=y(mod z), x = az + y for some integer a. Let this be Identity 1.1</p>
        <p>Using this, let's prove our second identity. Sit tight.</p>
        <h3>Identity 1.2</h3>
        <p>If x=y(mod z), x-y=0(mod z)</p>
        <p>Let a be an integer</p>
        <p>Firstly, using identity 1.1, x = az + y. Then x - y = ax + y - y = ax = 0(mod x)</p>
        <p>Notice how we let a be an integer, not a <b>positive integer</b> but an <b>integer</b>.</p>
        <p>This means that the identity also applies for negative values of mod. But... that makes no sense!</p>
        <h3>Identity 1.3</h3>
        <p>-x=y-x(mod y)</p>
        <p>This is a follow-up for identity 1.2</p>
        <p>So what is a negative mod?!</p>
        <p>If we understand this concept, everything from now on will be much easier.</p>
        <p>Let's try some things out. Hmmm well 2 = 2(mod 3) obviously. Then 2^2 = 1(mod 3)</p>
        <p>So what numbers when squared become 1? Well, 1 squared obviously works but 1 is not equal to 2. That must mean that the other solution, or -1 is 2 in this case. This is the most crucial step</p>
        <p>Think about it</p>
        <p>Now as for the actual identity, we can see that a = a + b(mod b)</p>
        <p>So if we replace a with -x, we get identity 1.3</p>
        <p>But you might have a question: How does the crucial step even work and why is it true? We'll leave this as an excersise to the reader... sike </p>
        <h3>Identity 1.4</h3>
        <p> x * y(mod z) = x(mod z) * y(mod z)</p>
        <p>Let a b, c and d be integers such that x = az + b, and y = cz + d </p>
        <p>
          x * y = (az + b)(cz + d) = acz<span class="power">2</span> + (ad + bc)z + bd = bd(mod z)
        </p>
        <p>Identity 1.4 is now proven</p>
        <p>And we're done yay!</p>
