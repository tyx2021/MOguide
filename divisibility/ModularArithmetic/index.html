        <h1>Modular Arithmetic</h1>
        <h2>Introduction: What is Modular Arithmetic?</h2>
        <p>In mathematics, modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" when reaching a certain value, called the modulus. The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, published in 1801.</p>
        <p class="credit">This is from wikipedia</p>
        <p>So, how does Modular Arithmetic work?</p>
        <p>Essentially, Modular Arithmetic is "remainder" but better. If you don't know what a remainder is, a remainder is the amount of stuff left after you divide something. For example 7 &#247; 4 = 1 remainder 3 because 1 x 4 + 3 = 7</p>
        <p>Simple enough, now if we use the previous example, we could rewrite it as 7=3(mod 4) because 3 was the remainder when 7 was divided by 4. In general, if x &#247; y = a Remainder(From here on referred as R) z where a is a whole no., y = z(mod x)</p>
        <p>Now try this question:What is 10(mod 3)?</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the solution</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>10 &#247; 3 = 3 R 1 </p>
            <p>Therefore 10 = 1(mod 3)</p>
