    <h1>Approximation</h1>
    </body>
    <p>So let’s say you see the question, like find the integer part of 1/[(1/81)+(1/82)+(1/83)+(1/84)]. This question is a classic, and although it looks complex and intimidating, it is actually easy to solve.</p>
    <p>Remember, you only need to find the integer part. For these types of questions, we use a method that narrows down the range of the answer.</p> 
    <b>IMPORTANT:YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW THE ACTUAL VALUE</b>
    <p>In this case it is like this:<br>
        So 1/80 has the largest value and 1/84 has the least value in this question. Let’s say that all the fractions (1/82, 1/83 etc) are replaced by 1/80. The resulting value would be greater than the actual value, but we ignore that for now. So 1/[(1/80)x5] would be equal to 16. We do the same for 1/84 and replace it into the solution, and the result would be smaller than the actual value. This new value is 84/5, or 16.8. The actual value is somewhere between 16 and 16.8, therefore we know that the integer part of the actual value is 16.
    </p>
    <p>For other approximation questions, if the non-integer part is very small, typically it is ignored in the calculation. Generally you should find integers which are close to the results that are close to the actual value to find the answer.
