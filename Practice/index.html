            <p>
                The ant needs 15 movements to reach from one end to the other. Therefore the ant can move to the other end in 15C5 x 10C5 x 5C5 ways, or 756756 ways.

            <p>
              The rate at which group A builds the wall is 1/6. The rate at which group B builds the wall is 1/3. The rate at which group A and B build the wall = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2. It takes 2 days</p>

        <p>The number <span class="overline">92x8y</span> is divisible by 55. What are the possible values of x and y?</p>
        <button class="accordion">Show the Solution</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>
              Since <span class="overline">92x8y</span> is divisible by 55, it is divisible by 5 and 11. <br>
              Therefore, y = 0 or 5<br>
              If y = 0,<br>
              Since <span class="overline">92x8y</span> is divisible by 11<br>,
              2 + 8 - (9 + x + 0) = 1 - x = 0<br>
              x = 1<br>
              If y = 5,<br>
              Since <span class="overline">92x8y</span> is divisiblel by 11<br>
              (9 + x + 5) - (2 + 8) = 4 + x = 11<br>
              x = 7<br>
              Hence the solutions are y = 0, x = 1 and y = 5, x = 7.
